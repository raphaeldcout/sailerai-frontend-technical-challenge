# Chat Frontend Technical Challenge

This is a real-time chat project developed in [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/docs/13/getting-started), using advanced tools such as `Typescript`, `Styled-components`, `Modular Components`, `Storybook` and `Jest` to support a good project architecture. Development principles such as `Clean Code` and `SOLID` were also used.
